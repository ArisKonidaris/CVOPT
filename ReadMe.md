Master course: ECE622

### Getting Started

CVOPT algorithm is implemented in two phases. In the first phase we read the input data from a kafka topic, then we 
calculate the count, mean and standard deviation for each stratum (i.e. each distinct group bys) and finally we store
these attributes along with the corresponding group into a kafka-sink topic. In the second phase we read the statistics 
generated by the first phase and we compute the memory distribution of each stratum (i.e. si). At the same time we read 
the input data and we apply reservoir sampling for each group based on the corresponding si variable. 

### KafkaStreamProducer Class
This class is a simple implementation for a kafka producer that evenly partitions the data (based on the number of kafka 
partitions) and sends the corresponding data points to the specified topic. The program terminates when all data is send
to the kafka topic. In order for this program to work you have to create beforehand the kafka topic in the kafka cluster 
with the same topic name and number of partitions. A simple command is the following:

```
kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 4 --replication-factor 1 --topic OpenAQ
```

Class variables which need to be specified:
```
String filePath: Dataset file path, DEFAULT VALUE="/src/main/java/dataset/2018-04-04.csv"
String topicName: Name of Kafka Topic, DEFAULT VALUE="OpenAQ"
Integer partitions: Number of Kafka Partitions, DEFAULT VALUE="4"
```

### StratumStatistics Class
This class reads the input data from the kafka cluster based on KafkaStreamProducer.topicName and calculates the statistics 
for each group. This class is implemented as a Flink DataStream Job and can be executed with parallelism > 1. This Job does not
terminate by default and results are emitted once the KeyedProcessFunction timer fires for each stratum. The final result (i.e. 
set of strata) is sorted based on the group bys. This gives the user the opportunity to choose the values of the weight vector for 
the second phase of the algorithm. You have to specify the following parameters:
```
String kafka_data_topic: Name of kafka topic that holds the data, DEFAULT VALUE="OpenAQ"
String kafka_broker_list: Addresses of kafka brokers, DEFAULT VALUE="localhost:9092"
String parallelism: Number of Flink parallel task slots, DEFAULT VALUE="4"
String groupBys: Indexes of group bys columns (starting from 1 to n), DEFAULT VALUE="3,6,8"
Integer aggregate_column: Aggregate column (starting from 1 to n), DEFAULT VALUE="7"
String kafka_sink_topic: Name of kafka sink topic used to store stratistics per stratum, DEFAULT VALUE="Statistics"
Long timeout: Time in msec for KeyedProcessFunction timer. This is the maximum waiting period of each stratum, DEFAULT VALUE="1000"
``` 

```
/usr/local/flink-1.10.0/bin/flink run -c cvopt_jobs.StratumStatistics /home/user/../CVOPT/target/CVOPT-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --parallelism 4
```
A sample output of the above command is the following.Each line represents a stratum: 

(stratum group bys, stratum mean, stratum standard deviation, stratum size)

### Sampling Class
This class is the second phase of the CVOPT algorithm and reads both the stratum statistics and the input data in order to apply the 
reservoir sampling algorithm. This class is implemented as a Flink DataStream Job and can be executed with parallelism > 1. This Job 
does not terminate by default and results are emitted once the KeyedProcessFunction timer fires for each stratum sample. In addition, 
we have implemented the Largest Remainder Method for the correct memory budget distribution M (i.e. si) and also we have implemented 
the Optimal Reservoir Sampling. You have to specify the following parameters:
```
String kafka_data_topic: Name of kafka topic that holds the data, DEFAULT VALUE="OpenAQ"
String kafka_statistics_topic: Name of kafka topic that holds the strata statistics, DEFAULT VALUE="Statistics"
String kafka_broker_list: Addresses of kafka brokers, DEFAULT VALUE="localhost:9092"
String parallelism: Number of Flink parallel task slots, DEFAULT VALUE="4"
String groupBys: Indexes of group bys columns (starting from 1 to n), DEFAULT VALUE="3,6,8"
int aggregate_column: Aggregate column (starting from 1 to n), DEFAULT VALUE="7"
Integer memory_budget: Size of memory budget, DEFAULT VALUE="150"
String weight_vector: Weight coefficients, DEFAULT VALUE="1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1"
Long timeout: Time in msec for KeyedProcessFunction timer. This is the maximum waiting period of each stratum, DEFAULT VALUE="1000"
```

```
/usr/local/flink-1.10.0/bin/flink run -c cvopt_jobs.Sampling  /home/user/.../CVOPT/target/CVOPT-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --parallelism 4
```
A sample output of the above command is the following.Each line represents a stratum sample: 

(stratum group bys, stratum mean, stratum standard deviation, stratum size, si, sample size, sample mean, sample standard deviation, sample records)

### Default Dataset
We used a real-world dataset, "OpenAQ, 2018-04-04.csv" with 436 data tuples and 11 columns of  157 KB. OpenAQ is a collection of air 
quality measurements of different substances, such as carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, etc. We downloaded the data set from:
